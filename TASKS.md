# Update Tasks
- [ ] Research multi-repo composition patterns (microfrontends, plugin loaders) to refine cross-repo layering without duplication.
- [ ] Expand `registry.json` to include version pins and integrity hashes for sibling data.
- [ ] Implement optional schema tests for `assets/data/interface.schema.json` to guard contributions.
- [ ] Add graceful fallbacks when sibling repos are unavailable so `composeView` still returns a usable snapshot.
- [ ] Document Safety UI controls and cross-repo loading flow in `README_RENDERER.md`.
