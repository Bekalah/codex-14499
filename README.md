# Codex 144:99 — Alpha↔Omega Monad (Motherboard)

This is the board for Cathedral of Circuits.
It carries the seven ribbons (SCIENCE · CANON · PSYCH · CRAFT · ESOTERIC · RESEARCH · FUSION),
research-grade schemas, a shared Ribbon Mandala, and starter nodes/labs.
All other repos (book, engine, tarot, cathedral) plug in as circuits.
ND-safe: no autoplay, no strobe; PSYCH is backstage (research/tech), not story.
