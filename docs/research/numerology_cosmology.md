# Numerical Cosmology Atlas (0–144)

This atlas gathers numerological currents across Pythagorean, Chaldean, Kabbalistic, Chinese (I Ching), Vedic, Tibetan, and Mayan frames and folds them into modular design prompts. Each node can seed artwork, architecture, music, or pedagogy within Codex 144:99's layered cosmology.

## How to Read the Atlas

- **Resonance fields** translate each number through multiple lineages, showing shared themes without privileging a single canon.
- **Design toolkit** highlights color, geometry, sound, materials, and architectural moves for offline fabrication or studio exploration.
- **Cycle mapping** repeats long traditions (hexagrams, nakshatras, animals, day signs) so every node retains a bridge into living calendars.
- **Use in practice**: select one node or braid several to script installations, learning modules, game mechanics, or rituals. Combine with the helix renderer to craft physical or digital cathedrals of meaning.

## Numerology Constants

The renderer and atlas lean on sacred integers 3, 7, 9, 11, 22, 33, 99, 144. Use them to scale canvases, subdivide time signatures, or constrain architectural grids.
